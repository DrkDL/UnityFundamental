Unity Game #2

Hi, this is my second tutorial game made by Unity.
This game is about a charactor with skin can move in 360 degree on the platform with proper animation.
The charactor is controlled by the mouse pointer.
There are also other imported prefabs for the 3D map structures.

The assets are obtained from the Pluralsight training program.
